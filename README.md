# MTACannedExamples

## Purpose
The purpose of these builds are to show you what can be done in a canned fashion.  These builds can be great learning tools and even jumping off points into other applications on the RHMAP platform.

Keep in mind that builds here, while they are catered for RHMAP, can be spun up locally and ran pretty much anywhere.

## Tools Required
In order to use the examples appropriatly, please have (if you're on a mac) the following installed.
* nvm
* vscode 
* potentially other tools
* Redis and Mongo running locally (we prefer docker)
