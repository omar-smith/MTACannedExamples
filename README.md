# MTACannedExamples

## Overview
The purpose of these builds are to show you what can be done in a canned fashion.  These builds can be great learning tools and even jumping off points into other applications on the RHMAP platform.

Keep in mind that builds here, while they are catered for RHMAP, can be spun up locally and ran pretty much anywhere.

## Tools Required
In order to use the examples appropriatly, please have the following installed.
* nvm (or alternative for Windows)
* VSCode 
* Docker running Redis and Mongo


## Directions
For all applications, ensure that you run `npm install` for each subfolder to ensure that you have required libraries installed.

Please ensure that you have `grunt` installed locally: `npm install -g grunt`.

Please ensure that redis and mongo are up and running within docker.  

To start mongo:
```
docker run -p 27017:27017 --name mongo -d mongo
```

To start redis:
```
docker run -p 6379:6379 --name redis -d redis
```

_Keep in mind that **mongo** or **redis** can be restarted by simply typing in the name._
```
docker start mongo (or redis)
```

_If you need to make changes to the parameters associated with the container, you'll need to remove and restart the container with arguments (like above)._
```
docker rm mongo (or redis)
```

## Overviews and Tasks
1. First Express Application
    * Overview
        * Utilize **example_01_express_app**.
        * After `npm` has completed, execute and run the application: `grunt serve`
        * In a separate terminal or using Postman, interact with the cloud application by issuing a `curl localhost:9001/hello`.
            * This should return a JSON response to your caller:
            ```
            {"msg":"Hello World"}
            ```
    * Tasks
        1. Add a new library and endpoint.  Ensure that you can call using the `curl` command.
        2. Ensure that you get a return to your calling application to validate things are working correctly.
2. Debugging Node.js Applications
    * Overview
        * Utilize **example_01_express_app**.
        * There are many alternatives to use for debugging.  In this example, we're going to utilize VSCode for Debugging.
        * A great guide is located here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging.
        * Please read and follow instructor for how to use.
    * Tasks
        * Utilizing the built in debugging, choose the debugger icon on the left.  
        * Before starting the build, ensure that **_Launch Example 1_** is selected.  Hit start and the build should start.
        * Set a breakpoint in the code.  Utilizing `curl localhost:9001/hello`, hit one of the endpoints.  VSCode should pause on the breakpoint and require you to continue.
3. Debugging Node.js - Finding the Bugs
    * Overview
        * Utilize **example_02_find_bugs**.
        * There are 3 bugs within the application.  Use the debugger to find them.
        * In order to start the build, use **_Launch Example 2_**
    * Tasks
        * Utilizing the debugging application, attempt to trace and find the bugs.  There are 3 bugs.
            * #1 -- `curl localhost:8001/bug1` should return the following (note that curl defaults to GET):
            ```
            ["1","2","3","4"]
            ```
            * #2 -- `curl localhost:8001/bug2` should return the following:
            ```
            [[1,2,3,4],["hi","there"]]
            ```
            * #3 -- `curl localhost:8001/bug3` should return the following:
            ```
            {"msg":"Hello World"}
            ```
4. Utilizing Unit Tests
    * Overview
        * Utilize **example_03_unit_test**.
        * Currently there are 10 unit tests located in test/unit.
        * In order to run tests, either run `grunt unit` or utilize the VS Code debugger and run **_Launch Example 3_**.
    * Tasks
        1. Create unit tests for another endpoint library called `helloTwo`.  Place the unit test at the end of the file and name it:
        ```
        exports.it_should_test_helloTwo_UnitTestFunction = function(finish) {...
        ```
        2. Copy the current `test-hello.js` file and ensure that it's referencing the new endpoint library.  You should use an existing GET call for reference.
        3. An expected response in the output should contain: 
        ```
        âœ“ it_should_test_helloTwo_UnitTestFunction
        ```
